        For most of my life I have been the one in my family and circle of
        friends who was the go to for fixing computers and giving advice on
        technical purchases. I spent many hours pulling apart and rebuilding
        PCs, installing operating systems.

        A few years ago I decided to take this thread and start weaving it more promentently
        into my life and began to learn and build projects. Now, while still working
        full time I dedicated as much free times as I can learning and practicing.
